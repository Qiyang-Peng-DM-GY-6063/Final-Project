[00:00.95]In the town where I was born
[00:05.02]Lived a man who sailed to sea
[00:09.62]And he told us of his life
[00:14.34]In the land of submarines
[00:18.58]So we sailed on to the sun
[00:22.94]'Til we found a sea of green
[00:27.48]And we lived beneath the waves
[00:31.84]In our yellow submarine
[00:36.44]We all live in a yellow submarine
[00:40.99]Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
[00:45.39]We all live in a yellow submarine
[00:49.45]Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
[00:53.54]And our friends are all aboard
